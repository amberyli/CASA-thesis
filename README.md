# CASA-thesis

Here is to store the model of codes and used pcitures of my master thesis.

The sharing here is for the purpose of reproducibility.

---

**To download the full model, [download this nlogo file here](https://github.com/amberyli/CASA-thesis/blob/main/code/draft.nlogo)**

> You would need to have the NetLogo software ready to run this model successfully.

**To just view the code, [download the raw code file here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amberyli/CASA-thesis/main/code/draft-code.html)**

> It is exported directly through NetLogo. No worry about its messy performance, right-click to save it as local file and open it. The nice format would be presented to you.

**To check the outputs from BehaviorSpace, [download the 3 csv files here](https://github.com/amberyli/CASA-thesis/tree/main/code)**

> Notice the outputs from BehaviorSpace would be slightly different.
